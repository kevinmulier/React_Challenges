# Landing Page Countdown Timer

## Introduction

This Countdown Timer is a React application designed to count down until a "Grand Reveal" day, providing a dynamic display of the time remaining. This application showcases the use of React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`, to manage state and side effects, creating an engaging user experience as the countdown updates in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Countdown**: Calculates and displays the months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Utilizes `setInterval` within a `useEffect` hook to update the countdown every second, ensuring the display is always accurate.
- **Customizable Target Date**: While set to count down to September 2024, the target date can be easily modified to any future date.
- **Reusable Component**: Implements a `TimeRemaining` component to display each unit of time (months, days, hours, minutes, seconds), promoting code reuse and simplifying modifications.
- **Responsive Design**: Adopts a responsive layout for optimal viewing on devices of varying sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
